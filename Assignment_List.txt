Spheres and Triangles

Due Feb 22 by 11:59pm

Points 100

Create a simple ray tracer.  This will be the basis for future assignments.
You need only support spheres and triangles as shapes.

One ray per pixel - This will be relaxed in later assignments

No acceleration structures yet - test each shape for intersections

No scene file - you will be able to hard code a scene every assignment.

Only point light sources - this will be relaxed in later assignments

Only use lambertian shading - this will change in future assignments

Turn in an image that shows a sphere above and casting a shadow on a plane (made of two or more triangles)
that was produced by your ray tracer.

BVH and Meshes

Due Mar 1 by 11:59pm

Points 100

Extend your ray tracer to be able to read large triangular meshes from a file as part of a scene.

Support the PLY format.

Also add a BVH acceleration structure with the surface area heuristic.

Turn in an image of a model containing at least 1 M triangles.
