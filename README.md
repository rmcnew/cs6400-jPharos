# cs6400-jPharos
jPharos is a simple Java-based Ray Tracer made for CS 6400:  Computer Graphics II

Note:  Normal object-oriented design principles are not followed for many of the jPharos classes.  Typically, class data is private and only accessible through well-defined selector and mutator functions (i.e. "getters" and "setters").  

Most of the jPharos ray tracer classes are read-only value classes that represent geometric primitives and mathematical operations, so the normal use of encapsulation and data hiding is not appropriate.  ([Rich Hickey's "The Value of Values" talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM) gives a great overview of values and how the immutability of values enhances the ability to reason about software.)  

The purpose of selector and mutator functions is to hide the classâ€™s internal implementation details.  This is usually not needed for value classes since they are read-only.  Functions that produce a different value do not mutate the value object in place, but rather create a new object for the new value.
